## KeyError: 'level_0'

```bash
$ python - <<'PY'
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'a':[1,2]})
print(df['level_0'])
PY
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 5, in <module>
KeyError: 'level_0'
```

### Why this happens

The `'level_0'` column name commonly appears when working with MultiIndex columns or after some reshaping operations (like `stack`/`unstack` or writing a DataFrame with a MultiIndex to CSV and reading it back). The `KeyError` occurs either because you expect a `level_0` column but it was never created, or because the name is different than you expected.

Common situations:

- `reset_index()` on a MultiIndex may create columns named `level_0`, `level_1`, … if original index levels had no names.
- Reading a CSV that used MultiIndex columns can cause `level_0` to appear in columns or not depending on `header`/`index_col` arguments.
- Attempting to access a missing column named `'level_0'` will raise `KeyError`.

### Fix

- Inspect the columns using `df.columns` to find the actual names.
- Use `df.reset_index(drop=True)` to drop index columns instead of creating `level_*` columns if you don't need them.
- Rename the new columns to meaningful names: `df.rename(columns={'level_0': 'index'}, inplace=True)`.
- If a CSV read created unintended `level_0`, check `pd.read_csv(..., header=[0,1])` or `index_col=0` usage.

#### Wrong code

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assume a CSV was read without specifying index_col for a multi-indexed file
df = pd.read_csv('data_with_multiindex.csv')
# Then someone tries to access a column that doesn't exist
print(df['level_0'])  # raises KeyError if column not present
```

#### Fixed code

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data_with_multiindex.csv', header=[0,1])  # if the file stores multi-index columns
# If `level_0` is present but you don't like the name, rename it
if 'level_0' in df.columns:
    df = df.rename(columns={'level_0': 'index'})

# Or drop if it's an unwanted index created by reset_index
if 'level_0' in df.columns and df['level_0'].isnull().all():
    df = df.drop(columns=['level_0'])

# Check available columns explicitly
print(df.columns)
```

Notes:

- The exact presence and naming of `level_0` depends on the DataFrame's structure and the I/O that produced it. Always inspect your columns and index before accessing them by name.
